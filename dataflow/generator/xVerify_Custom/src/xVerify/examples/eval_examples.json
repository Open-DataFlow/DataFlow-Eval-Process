        "llm_output": "To find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ of $P_z$, we first need to find the expectation value of $P_z$, $\\langle P_z \\rangle$. \n\nThe state of the system is given by the column vector $(-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$. The matrix form of the operator $P_z$ is given as:\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe expectation value of $P_z$ is given by:\n\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z | \\psi \\rangle$\n\nwhere $| \\psi \\rangle$ is the state of the system. \n\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2) \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\hbar \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = (-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2) \\begin{pmatrix} -\\hbar/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = -\\hbar/2 + 0 - \\hbar/2$\n\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = -\\hbar$\n\nNext, we need to find the expectation value of $P_z^2$, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.\n\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | P_z^2 | \\psi \\rangle$\n\nwhere $| \\psi \\rangle$ is the state of the system. \n\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2) \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\hbar^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2, 1/\\sqrt{2}, -1/2) \\begin{pmatrix} \\hbar^2/4 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\hbar^2/4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2/4 + 0 + \\hbar^2/4$\n\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2$\n\nNow, we can find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ of $P_z$ using the formula:\n\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\hbar^2 - (-\\hbar)^2}$\n\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\hbar^2 - \\hbar^2}$\n\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{0}$\n\n$\\Delta P_z = 0$\n\nHowever, this is not one of the answer choices. We made a mistake in the calculation. We should not have used the given state of the system as the eigenvector of $P_z$. Instead, we should have used the given state of the system as the eigenvector of $P_x$. \n\nTo find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ of $P_z$, we need to find the state of the system in the basis of the eigenvectors of $P_z$. \n\nThe eigenvectors of $P_z$ are given by:\n\n$| \\psi_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, | \\psi_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, | \\psi_z \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe state of the system in the basis of the eigenvectors of $P_z$ is given by:\n\n$| \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = a | \\psi_z \\rangle + b | \\psi_z \\rangle + c | \\psi_z \\rangle$\n\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the coefficients of the eigenvectors of $P_z$.\n\nWe can find the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ by using the orthogonality of the eigenvectors of $P_z$.\n\n$a = \\langle \\psi_z | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = -1/2$\n\n$b = \\langle \\psi_z | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$\n\n$c = \\langle \\psi_z | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix} = -1/2$\n\nNow, we can find the expectation value of $P_z$, $\\langle P_z \\rangle$.\n\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = a \\langle \\psi_z | P_z | \\psi_z \\rangle + b \\langle \\psi_z | P_z | \\psi_z \\rangle + c \\langle \\psi_z | P_z | \\psi_z \\rangle$\n\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = -1/2 \\hbar + 0 + (-1/2) (-\\hbar)$\n\n$\\langle P_z \\rangle = 0$\n\nNext, we need to find the expectation value of $P_z^2$, $\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle$.\n\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = a \\langle \\psi_z | P_z^2 | \\psi_z \\rangle + b \\langle \\psi_z | P_z^2 | \\psi_z \\rangle + c \\langle \\psi_z | P_z^2 | \\psi_z \\rangle$\n\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = a \\hbar^2 + b 0 + c \\hbar^2$\n\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = (-1/2) \\hbar^2 + (-1/2) \\hbar^2$\n\n$\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle = \\hbar^2$\n\nNow, we can find the uncertainty $\\Delta P_z$ of $P_z$ using the formula:\n\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}$\n\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\hbar^2 - 0}$\n\n$\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\hbar^2}$\n\n$\\Delta P_z = \\hbar$\n\nThe answer is (C) $\\hbar$.",
