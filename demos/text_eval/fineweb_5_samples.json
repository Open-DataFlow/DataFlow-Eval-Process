Well, sort of.\nAccording to a NASCAR press release, \"NASCAR Media Group\u2019s archival library contains 65,000 hours of race footage and other historical content.\" That means the current iTunes offering is only about .015% of all NASCAR has to offer.\nNASCAR says iTunes is just one of a number of platforms it's exploring to make historical content available to fans, so it looks like there will be more. But, for now, if we want to relive the good ol' days, I suppose we're stuck with a couple of iTunes episodes and whatever YouTube has to offer.\nFor more current (and free) content, there's always the \"NASCAR on SPEED\" broadband channel. At some point, though, it'd be nice to see a 24/7 all-NASCAR TV network like the NFL, NBA, MLB, and even the NHL, already have.\nSeriously, if NASA can have a TV station, why can't NASCAR?",

        "text": "Silence of the la(m)bs\nDo you remember the time warp that sometimes followed a question from an instructor, back in your college days? When all sound was sucked out of the classroom, along with most of the air, so we all held our breath, waiting for the moment to pass?\nAt first you may have thought: this was a rhetorical question, the Prof doesn\u2019t really want an answer. But then the silence thickened and the Prof kept staring, eyebrows raised. It was getting hot in the room, and you felt a sudden urge to read the EXIT sign above the door over and over. The quiet was deafening. A sneak peek at the class confirmed your suspicion that the Prof is still trying to make eye contact and coax an answer \u2013 but the gazes were firmly parted down the middle, for everyone else was also busy examining their fingernails, the cobwebs on the ceiling, and the clock\u2019s arms ticking by in slow motion. In those awkward seconds, have you ever wondered:\nWhy do teachers ask questions?\nInstructors ask questions for a variety of reasons. However, their objective is usually the same: to enhance student comprehension.\n\u201cI ask questions for two reasons.\u201d \u2013 explains Carol Subi\u00f1o Sullivan, Faculty Teaching and Learning Specialist. \u2013 \u201cFirst, to assess students\u2019 learning and understanding of the topic. Second, I use questions as a vehicle to open up a discussion that will help them explore different perspectives.\u201d\nDr. Sullivan is describing the two main uses of questioning in education: the use of lower level, or factual, questions commonly posed to check if students are following along before moving to the next concept, and higher level, or critical thinking, questions, designed to challenge assumptions, explore diverse views, connect content to real-world scenarios and promote self-reflection.\nWait, those are all things students should be excited to do, right? So\u2026\nWhy would students rather not answer?\nMore often than not, there are good reasons behind students not volunteering to answer a question in class.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the fear of judgment from peers as well as the instructor. This just gets worse as class size increases. Even if there\u2019s a welcoming atmosphere, there\u2019s just a lot of pressure.\u201d \u2013 shares Darrion, a computer science major at Georgia Tech.\nIndeed, based on a review1, only about 25% of college students are willing to respond to questions in a lecture, and that participation further drops as class size increases2.\nClass size, however, does not explain it all. The kind of question being asked also matters a great deal.\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t know the answer 100%, I don\u2019t want to put myself out there. Especially at the beginning of a course, you just don\u2019t know what the class dynamic is going to be like.\u201d \u2013 adds A, a biochemistry major.\nHer experience is common among students: if it appears that the question has one specific correct answer (a.k.a. a convergent question) the professor is looking for, a student can feel like she has little to gain even if she gets the answer right, but has much to lose by \u201csaying something dumb\u201d in front of the entire class. Considering these odds, staying mute makes perfect sense.\nWhat if the question is very easy? Well, that\u2019s just suspicious. While instructors sometimes pose questions specifically to elicit the wrong answer, in an attempt to demonstrate a common misconception, imagine how it feels to learn that not only was your answer wrong, you were set up for failure in front of everyone. Conclusion? If it sounds too easy \u2013 it probably isn\u2019t. Keep your head down.\nAnd then there are the questions that are so simple they are insulting. Have you ever heard of Napoleon? \u2013 asked the instructor in a central European history classroom3. Silence followed her words. She took it as a sign that her students were vastly underprepared if they haven\u2019t even heard of Napoleon. Consider for a moment how infuriating this question must have sounded to her student Mary, who wrote her junior thesis on the topic. Answering the professor\u2019s question would have been analogous to answering \u201cWhat color is this yellow pencil?\u201d \u2013 just duh.\nSo how do we make questions work for everyone?\nToday, of course, The Silence is just as uncomfortable for us as instructors as it is for students. While our students may not catch on (as they are busy looking for escape routes), the sage on the stage is likely experiencing the same urge to flee as they are, garnished by accelerated breathing, dilating pupils and a sudden onset of profuse sweating.\nThe key to avoiding the awkward stalemate is\u2026\nWhen you are planning a class, consider the following4:\n- How large is the group?\n- What are the backgrounds of students (year in school, major, previous education and experience etc.)\n- What prerequisites or other courses have they had?\n- What do the students hope to gain from this course?\nAssessing your audience will help you with\u2026\nAsking the right questions\nIf you have a good grasp of what your students know or don\u2019t know, it will be easier to calibrate your questions to be just the perfect blend of challenging but manageable.\nDarrion points to another hack: \u201cI would be more comfortable answering questions if we were assigned more pre-class work. With more prep, I have more confidence to answer.\u201d Questions from readings are also a great way to check whether students are completing their assignments.\nDr. Sullivan highlights the importance of what type of question we ask: \u201cI avoid asking: \u2018Any questions?\u2019 Because that is a sure-fire way to get silence. I am very intentional about asking specific questions. For example, instead of asking \u2018What did you think about the reading? \u2018I would ask: \u2018What\u2019s one idea that you disagreed with?\u2019 \u201c\nAsking questions at the right time\nAnxiety over others\u2019 judgment combined with uncertainty about knowing the correct answer to a question creates the perfect, silent, storm. It is worth lowering the stakes by first offering divergent questions that allow for multiple answers. As it is wisely offered by A: \u201cBefore asking <What\u2019s the correct answer?> professors could ask \u2018How might we start to solve this problem?\u2019\u201d.\nSo assume both you and your students have done your homework. Are we out of the bushes yet? Have we gotten rid of awkward silences for good? Not quite. Not all questions are pre-planned, nor should they be. Sometimes, as the class unfolds, the instructor wants to grab a teachable moment that has arisen organically \u2013 a question neither they or the students prepped for. But the question catches everyone off guard \u2013 so instructors have to do a bit of\u2026\nSalvaging on the fly\nUh-oh, it\u2019s the silence again. How am I gonna get out of this one?\n\u201cWhen nobody wants to answer a question, the most important thing is to wait. Sometimes students just need time to process the question. But waiting is hard, so I hold on by focusing on my breathing: I take at least two full breaths before I speak up again.\u201d \u2013 offers Dr. Sullivan.\nResearch confirms that instructors only wait 3.75 seconds5 on average after asking a question in class before they move on. If the question in question is complex, it is understandable why one might want to think more than 4 seconds before offering their opinion.\nWhat if you just can\u2019t keep waiting any longer? Don\u2019t give up! Turn the attention away from the podium by handing over the conversation to the students: \u201cIf we talk in pairs first, and we come up with something, then I\u2019m more willing to share. You also learn the material better that way.\u201d \u2013 suggests A.\nAny question can be turned into a quick think-pair-share activity. Alternatively, you can ask students to write down some ideas on a piece of paper \u2013 they will similarly be more confident after having had some time to formulate their ideas.\nIf you asked a factual question, you can ask students to open their books and find the answer, or look it up on their devices \u2013 you can even throw in a prize for the one who gets it first.\nTwo more creative ways to engage students who might otherwise not volunteer (without calling on them) is having the whole class answer as a chorus6 or using the beach ball method:\nAll shall not be quiet on the lectern front\nQuestions are perhaps the most powerful vehicle to learning ever invented. Keeping the discussion alive in a classroom is imperative to ensure deep, meaningful comprehension and the exploration of diverse perspectives in a classroom. Do some smart planning and pick a few strategies that might work in your class \u2013 and carry on questioning!\n- Weaver, R. R., & Jiang Qi , J. (2005).
