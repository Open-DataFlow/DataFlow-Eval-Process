The probability of the spinner landing on $A$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$ and the probability of the spinner landing on $B$ is $\\frac{5}{12}$.  What is the probability of the spinner landing on $C$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
        "output": "The spinner is guaranteed to land on exactly one of the three regions, so we know that the sum of the probabilities of it landing in each region will be 1. If we let the probability of it landing in region $C$ be $x$, we then have the equation $1 = \\frac{5}{12}+\\frac{1}{3}+x$, from which we have $x=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$."

        "output": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no consonants. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, or $E$, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no consonant must be one of $A$ or $E$. So the number of all 4-letter words with no consonants is $2\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2=16$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is $625-16=\\boxed{609}$."

The probability neither of the dice is a 1 is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) = \\frac{25}{36}$.

        "instruction": "Let $p$ be the probability that, in the process of repeatedly flipping a fair coin, one will encounter a run of $5$ heads before one encounters a run of $2$ tails. Given that $p$ can be written in the form $m/n$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.\n",
        "output": "Think of the problem as a sequence of H's and T's. No two T's can occur in a row, so the sequence is blocks of $1$ to $4$ H's separated by T's and ending in $5$ H's. Since the first letter could be T or the sequence could start with a block of H's, the total probability is that $3/2$ of it has to start with an H.\nThe answer to the problem is then the sum of all numbers of the form $\\frac 32 \\left( \\frac 1{2^a} \\cdot \\frac 12 \\cdot \\frac 1{2^b} \\cdot \\frac 12 \\cdot \\frac 1{2^c} \\cdots \\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac 12\\right)^5$, where $a,b,c \\ldots$ are all numbers $1-4$, since the blocks of H's can range from $1-4$ in length. The sum of all numbers of the form $(1/2)^a$ is $1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16=15/16$, so if there are n blocks of H's before the final five H's, the answer can be rewritten as the sum of all numbers of the form $\\frac 32\\left( \\left(\\frac {15}{16}\\right)^n \\cdot \\left(\\frac 12\\right)^n \\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac 1{32}\\right)=\\frac 3{64}\\left(\\frac{15}{32}\\right)^n$, where $n$ ranges from $0$ to $\\infty$, since that's how many blocks of H's there can be before the final five. This is an infinite geometric series whose sum is $\\frac{3/64}{1-(15/32)}=\\frac{3}{34}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{37}$."
